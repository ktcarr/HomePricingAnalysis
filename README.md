# HomePricingAnalysis
The purpose of this project was to analyze home prices in Florida to determine if the presence of the pollutant "UFFI" had a statistically significant effect on home value. As part of the project, a theoretical scenario was posed to justify monetary compensation for home owners with UFFI in their homes based on the data available. The findings from this analysis were prepared for presentation to a law firm representing the affected home owners.

## Dataset
uffidata.xlsx contains 99 samples of home sales, with data about the each home including whether the home contained UFFI and the sale price.

## Data preparation and analysis
Data preparation and analysis was performed in the file Carr_K_11.Rmd.

## Report and recommendations
The findings are presented to the clients' theoretical law firm in Report.docx.
